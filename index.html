        <p>
            Hey there! My name is <u>Samuel Bodenhemier</u>, I am a Computer Science major at <i>Northern Arizona University.</i> I am currently a sophmore and I will be finishing up most of my gen-ed credits this semester meaning its all computer science from here on out! This is good for many reasons, but mostly because I love programming. My first experience with cs was in my junior year at high school when I took the <i>Computer Science Principles</i> course where we learned about how the internet and computers work as well as some simple javascript. I instantly fell in love with CS and from then on it has been my main focus.

            <b>C</b> - The main focus of my recent CS experience has been learning how to build and run programs written in the C language. <br>
            <b>Java</b> - I also have experience with the Java language and object oriented programming from taking <i>AP Computer Science A</i> in High School. <br>
            <b>Problem Solving</b> - I have extensive experience in working through and solving any problems that may arise. <br>
            <b>MIPS</b> - Through taking the <i>Computer Archetecture</i> course at NAU I have the fundamentals of building programs using MIPS Assembly language.

        <!-- projects section body -->
        <p>
            <b>Matching/Memory Game</b> - As a final project in my <i>AP Computer Science A</i> course, a partner and I built a memory game from scratch in Java. The project consisted of a grid of tiles, each containing an imaga of a random fruit; the player was tasked with remembering the position of several matching pairs of fruits at which point the tiles fliped and the player had to select the matching locations from memory.<br>
            <b>Maze Generator</b> - The final task in my <i>Computer Archetecture</i> course was creating a program which randomly generated a maze using MIPS assembly. In order to do say, I created a pseudorandom number generator from scratch in order to generate the maze.<br>
            <b>Red/Black tree</b> - I created many C programs in my <i>Data Structures</i> course, but the most difficult was in creating a program which organized data into a self fixing Red/Black tree. The program could also remove items from the tree, copy the tree, and pring the data in a multitude of ways.
